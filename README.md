# Sales-Approach-Analysis-with-Python
Hello, welcome again to my projects.

This repo hosts the project that earned me my DataCamp Profesional [certification](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DA0021457928745). For this project I was tasked to analyze data from the sales team of Pen and Printers. 

The executive team needed an update on sales approaches for the newly launched product line and they needed this information as soon as possible.
We need to know:
- How many customers were there for each approach?
- What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?
- Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
- Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use? Some
of these methods take more time from the team so they may not be the best for us
to use if the results are similar.
We donâ€™t really know if there are other differences between the customers in each group, so
anything you can tell us would be really helpful to give some context to what went well.
